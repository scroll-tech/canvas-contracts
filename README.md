## Welcome to Scroll Canvas

We are thrilled to have you join us in building unique discoveries with [Scroll Canvas](https://scroll.io/canvas), a new product designed for ecosystem projects to interact with users in a more tailored way.

Try Canvas at [scroll.io/canvas](https://scroll.io/canvas)

## Overview

**Scroll Canvas** allows users to showcase on-chain credentials, status, and achievements called **Badges** issued and collected across the Scroll ecosystem.
Users can mint a non-transferable and unique personal persona to collect and display their **Badges**.

### Key Features

- **Canvas**: Each Canvas is a smart contract minted through the `ProfileRegistry` contract by the user on Scrollâ€™s website.
- **Badges**: Attestations of achievements and traits verified through the [Ethereum Attestation Service](https://docs.attest.sh/docs/welcome) (EAS), issued by different projects and the Scroll Foundation.
  Badges are wallet-bound and non-transferable.

Differences between attestations and NFTs:

| Attestation | NFT |
| --- | --- |
| Witness Proofs | Tokenized Assets |
| Non-transferable | Transferable |
| Recorded on disk (blockchain history) | Recorded in memory (blockchain states) |
| Prove ownership at a point in time | Exercise custodianship of an asset |
